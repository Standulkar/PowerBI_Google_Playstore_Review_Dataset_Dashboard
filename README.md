# PowerBI_Google_Playstore_Review_Dataset_Dashboard

Power BI Dashboard to visualize insights of Google Play store and user reviews dataset

Project Overview - This project is a Power BI dashboard built on Google Play Store apps and user reviews data. The goal is to analyze app performance, popularity, user satisfaction, and sentiment trends to help stakeholders understand what drives successful apps and where improvements are needed. The dashboard is divided into two focused pages: 1.App Performance Overview, 2.User Reviews & Sentiment Insights.

-- PAGE 1: App Performance Overview. Goal - Understand app quality, popularity, pricing impact, and category performance.

🔹KPI Cards Metrics: Total Apps: 9,639, Total Reviews: ~2 Billion, Average Rating: 4.18, Total Installs: ~75 Billion

Insight: The Play Store ecosystem is massive and highly competitive. An average rating above 4.0 indicates overall good app quality, but competition for visibility is intense. 
📌 These KPIs give stakeholders an instant health check of the entire Play Store landscape.

🔹Count of Apps by Rating:
What it shows: Distribution of apps across ratings from 1 to 5
Key Insight: Most apps cluster between 4.0 – 4.5 ratings. Very few apps fall below 3.0, indicating poor-quality apps fail quickly or get removed
📌 This highlights that maintaining quality is no longer optional — it’s a baseline expectation.

🔹User Ratings by App Update Recency:
What it shows: Average rating trend based on last updated year
Insight: Apps updated more recently tend to have higher ratings. Older, less-maintained apps show rating decline.
📌 Business takeaway: Regular updates directly impact user satisfaction and perceived quality.

🔹Top 5 Category-wise Total Apps
Categories:
Family
Game
Tools
Business
Medical

Insight: Family and Game categories are the most saturated. High competition but also high demand
📌 This helps developers and businesses assess market saturation before launching an app.

🔹Avg Rating vs Total Installs vs Reviews

What it shows:
X-axis: Average Rating
Y-axis: Total Installs
Bubble Size: Review Count
Legend: Category

Key Insights: Some categories have high installs despite average ratings. Others have high ratings but limited reach
📌 Strategic insight: Popularity ≠ Quality. Visibility, category demand, and marketing play a huge role.

🔹Free vs Paid Apps by Average Rating 

Insight: Paid apps have slightly higher average ratings. Free apps dominate installs but may receive more mixed feedback
📌 This answers a critical pricing question — users rate paid apps more positively due to higher expectations and perceived value.

Page 1 Summary: This page helps stakeholders understand what drives app success — quality, updates, category competition, and pricing strategy.


-- PAGE 2: User Reviews & Sentiment Insights: Goal - Understand user feedback, satisfaction levels, and sentiment patterns

🔹 Overall Satisfaction Score - 0.18

Meaning: Sentiment score is slightly positive overall. Indicates more positive than negative feedback, but room for improvement
📌 This KPI acts as a sentiment health indicator.

🔹 Sentiment Overview

Breakdown:
Positive: ~64%
Negative: ~22%
Neutral: ~14%

Insight: Majority of users are satisfied. However, 1 in 5 reviews is negative, which is significant at scale
📌 This signals that ignoring user feedback can damage brand reputation.

🔹 Count of Reviews by Category & Sentiment

Insight: Categories like Family, Game, and Tools generate the highest review volume. Negative sentiment is present across all categories, not isolated
📌 High engagement categories need stronger support and faster issue resolution.

🔹 Avg Rating vs Avg Sentiment by Category

Insight: Higher ratings generally align with higher sentiment. Some categories show rating–sentiment mismatch. Users rate well but express concerns in reviews
📌 Ratings alone don’t tell the full story — sentiment analysis reveals hidden dissatisfaction.

🔹 Reviews by Sentiment

Insight: Sentiment distribution is balanced visually, reinforcing KPI findings
📌 Simple but effective validation of sentiment trends.

🔹 Category Performance

Insight: Categories like Game and Communication dominate user engagement. Smaller categories still contribute meaningful feedback
📌 Helps prioritize categories for improvement or investment.

Page 2 Summary: This page converts raw reviews into actionable emotional insights, helping teams understand why users are satisfied or unhappy.
